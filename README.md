# Deep Learning for Predictive Maintenance #
We attempt to use a deep learning model, Long Short Time Memory ([LSTM](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)) in particular, to predict component failures as described in the [Predictive Maintenance Modelling Guide](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Notebook/Predictive-Maintenance-Modelling-Guide-R-Notebook-1).
